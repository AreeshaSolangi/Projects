# Chinook SQL Analysis  

This project presents an analysis of the **Chinook database** using SQL, focusing on revenue trends, product performance, and customer behavior. The queries are designed to provide business insights that could guide decision-making in a retail or digital sales environment.  

### SQL Script  
[ChinookAnalysis.sql](./ChinookAnalysis.sql) â†’ Contains all SQL queries written for the analysis  

### Key Business Questions  
- Which product categories generate the highest revenue?  
- How do monthly and yearly sales trends evolve over time?  
- Which customers and regions contribute most to overall revenue?  

### ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

- **Tracks**: No single best-selling track was identified. A large majority of tracks (87%) were purchased only once, while 12% were purchased twice, highlighting very limited repeat sales at the individual track level.  

- **Genres**: Rock generated the largest share of revenue (36%), followed closely by Latin (30%), together dominating overall sales.  

- **Media Types**: Sales were highly concentrated in one format, with MPEG Audio Files generating $222.75 in revenue. Protected AAC Audio Files contributed marginally at $4.95, while all other formats recorded no sales. This indicates a clear customer preference for MPEG Audio Files.  

- **Playlists**: The *Music* playlist contributed $73.46 to overall revenue, outperforming all others by a wide margin.  

- **Artists**: The top three artists are:  
  1. Chico Science & NaÃ§Ã£o Zumbi  
  2. Caetano Veloso  
  3. Chico Buarque  
  Together, they contribute around 17% of total revenue.  

- **Regional Revenue**:  
  - Europe contributed the highest share of revenue, making it the most profitable region.  
  - North America followed as the second-largest contributor.  
  - South America, Oceania, and Asia generated comparatively smaller shares.  
  This highlights Europe and the USA as core revenue-driving markets.  

- **Yearly Performance**: Revenue trends showed growth in 2010 and 2012, but declines in 2011 and 2013, reflecting inconsistent year-over-year performance.
