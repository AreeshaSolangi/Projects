# 📊 Brazilian E-Commerce Sales Analysis  

## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes a large Brazilian e-commerce dataset to uncover **sales trends, customer behavior, product performance, and fulfillment efficiency**. The insights are visualized through an interactive dashboard and exploratory data analysis (EDA).  

The objective is to help businesses understand **customer purchase patterns, revenue distribution, and operational performance**, while also identifying areas for strategic improvement such as **customer retention, pricing strategies, and regional expansion**.

## ⚙️ Dataset  
The dataset includes details about:  
- **Orders** – purchase, approval, shipping, and delivery timestamps  
- **Payments** – payment type, installments, and values  
- **Products** – categories, pricing, and volume  
- **Customers** – customer location and demographics  
- **Reviews** – customer sentiment and ratings

## 🔍 Key Insights  
- 📈 **Revenue Growth**: Strong upward trend in 2017, with stable performance in 2018 but a **sharp dip in September**.  
- 🌍 **Geographic Concentration**: Most sales come from **São Paulo (SP), Rio de Janeiro (RJ), and Minas Gerais (MG)**, showing dependency on a few states.  
- 👥 **Customer Mix**: **90% new vs. 10% returning customers** → strong acquisition but weak retention.  
- 🛒 **Product Performance**:  
  - High-order categories: *bed & bath, beauty & health, sports & leisure*  
  - High-revenue categories: *beauty & health, watches & gifts, bed & bath*  
- 💳 **Payment Behavior**: Installments and full payments are balanced, but **higher prices reduce both types of transactions**, showing price sensitivity.  
- 🚚 **Fulfillment**: **97% successful deliveries**, only **0.6% cancellations**.
