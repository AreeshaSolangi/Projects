# ðŸ“ŠData Science Survey Analysis

## Project Overview
Analyzed the **Kaggle Data Science Survey 2017-2021** to uncover meaningful insights about respondentsâ€™ behavior, preferences, and professional profiles. This project demonstrates the ability to handle **real-world, messy survey data** and transform it into actionable intelligence for business and analytics purposes.

## Key Achievements
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized categorical responses for consistency.  
- **Categorical Handling & Mapping:** Grouped and encoded categories for columns such as tools, roles, industries, and education levels.  
- **Exploratory Analysis & Insights Generation:** Identified patterns in:  
  - Most commonly used tools and programming languages  
  - Distribution of coding experience across roles (Data Scientist vs. Data Analyst)  
  - Compensation trends by role and experience  
  - Demographics of survey respondents (age, gender, location)  
- **Visualization:** Created **bar charts and pie charts using matplotlib** to clearly communicate trends and patterns.  
- **Business Impact:** Highlighted actionable insights about tools adoption, experience, and compensation that can inform **hiring strategies, training programs, and tool adoption decisions**.  

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python** (pandas, matplotlib)  
- **Excel** (for preliminary data exploration, optional)
